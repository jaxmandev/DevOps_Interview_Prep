```

## Agile
```
The Agile methodology was developed as a response to growing frustrations with Waterfall and other highly structured, inflexible methodologies. 
This approach is designed to accommodate change and the need to produce software faster.
```
#### Features
```
- Individuals, interactions, and relationships OVER tools
- Customer collaboration throughout the development process
- Responds to change instead of following a set-in-stone plan
- Focuses on presenting working software, rather than documentation. 
```

#### Defining charcateristics
Unlike Waterfall, Agile is well equipped to handle the complexity and variability involved in development projects.
```
- Using the Agile approach, teams develop in short sprints or iterations, each of which includes a defined duration and list of deliverables, but in no particular order. 
- During sprints, teams work towards the goal of delivering working software (or some other tangible, testable output).
- Agile is collaboration-heavy, focusing on team strengths and efficiency, along with internal feedback from various departments and clients. 
```
```
--> Client satisfaction is the highest priority with the Agile approach, which teams achieve by continuously delivering working, tested, prioritized features.
```

### Pros:
``` 
- No budgetary constraints to introducing new requirements and predictable costs 
- Fully engages business stakeholders collaboration in the development process
- Lessened documentation requirements save time and money
- Small issues are identified before they become major problems
```

### Cons:
```
Hard to estimate the effort required to complete complex projects
Requires experienced resources
High failure risk when end-user requirements are vague
```

## Scrum 

Scrum is not a methodology but it is a framework used to manage the project, daily/weekly/monthly tasks. Great tool to use in a agile environment. 
```
- Framework: a supporting structure around which something can be built
```
```
A way to implement the Agile approach, Scrum borrows from Agile’s foundational beliefs and philosophy that teams and developers should collaborate heavily and daily.
It focuses on accountability, teamwork and iterative progress towards well-defined goals.
```
### Three pillars of scrum: 
1. Transparency & 
2. Inspection & 
3. Adaptation

#### Features
```
With Scrum, software is developed using an iterative approach in which smaller teams require self-organization and self-management. Disciplined workers require front and center—experience. 
```
- Team members break down end goals into smaller goals at the beginning and work through them using fixed-length iterations—or sprints—to build software and showcase it often (which usually last two weeks).
- Meetings play an important role in the Scrum approach, and during each sprint, daily planning meetings and demos take place to follow progress and gather feedback. - This incremental method promotes quick changes and development and adds value to complex projects. 
- Scrum incorporates the structure and discipline of more traditional software development methodologies with the flexibility and iterative practices of modern Agile. 

#### Scrum Roles
```
Product Owner - customers and stakeholders and a responsible for driving the product backlog
Scrum Master - responsible for making sure scrum is understood and implemented
Development Team - self organise, cross functional responsible for accomplishing the tasks set out in the product backlog
```
#### Scrum Ceremonies
```
Sprint Planning - discuss the overall project objective, then broken down into smaller increments which can be complemented in a sprint
Daily Scrum - aim for transparency as to what each team member has done and synchronise teamwork. Previous day review and today plan 15 min
Sprint Review - conducted at the end of each sprint, gain feedback and evaluate whether the increment is DoD
Sprint Retrospective - 90 min meeting to evaluate how well team worked and build a plan for improvement
```
#### Scrum Artefacts
- Key information the Scrum Team and stakeholders NEED TO KNOW for understanding
```
1. Product under development 
2. Activities done 
3. Activities being planned 
```
- Here are a the minimum required artefacts in a scrum project. 
```
1. Product Backlog - lists all features, requirements and fixes together form the changes to be made now
2. Sprint Backlog - forecast about what functionality will be made available in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality
3. Burn-Down Chart Sprint - tracks total work remaining for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. Progress tracking tool.
4. Increment - the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint combined with the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be a working product, which means it must be in a useable condition.
```
#### Conclusion
```
Agile helps continuous deployment of software 
Works hand in hand with DevOps 
SCRUM framework delivers Agile
```
## Agile & Scrum differences & synergies 
```
Agile is a methodology used in software development. Iteration lies at the heart of the Agile methodology. Meanwhile, scrum is a framework used to implement agile. Other frameworks include Kanban which is a more relaxed framework but still has agile values such as communication and transparency at the core.
```

#### Key differences
```
1. Agile is a continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process whereas Scrum is an Agile process to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time.
2. Agile methodology delivers the software on a regular basis for feedback while Scrum delivers the software after each sprint.
3. In the Agile process, leadership plays a vital role; on the other hand, Scrum fosters a self-organizing, cross-functional team.
4. Agile involves collaborations and face-to-face interactions between the members of various cross-functional teams whereas Scrum collaboration is achieved in daily stand up meetings.
5. In Agile process design and execution should be kept simple whereas in Scrum process design and execution can be innovative and experimental.
```

## What are the 3 amigos

The 3 amigos refer to a practice in Agile wherein the aim is to bridge departments in the company. This allows for a more holistic Definition of Done. The 3 amigos are typically:
```
- The Business Analyst – They make sure everyone understands the user stories and has the same expectations.
- Developers – They are responsible for requirements so will discuss their understanding of these.
- Tester – They will try to find edge cases to enhance the testing process.
```

#### What is Persona?
```
A person is a fictitious biography of a potential user of a product. They are typically visual and represent a certain category of user.
The aim of a person is not to have a designer or developer cater to every category but provide an anchor to justify design decisions.
```

## Software Development Methodologies
### Waterfall
```
Waterfall is the most traditional and sequential choice. Although it’s usually viewed as an ”old school” or outdated method, it’s helpful to understand the history and structure of Waterfall to better appreciate the flexibility of more modern methodologies. First created in 1970, Waterfall was one of the most prominent methodologies for several decades because of its plan-driven approach.
```
- Waterfall requires plenty of structure and documentation up front. 
- It is divided into self-contained stages or steps. 
```
The first stage is vital, requiring a full understanding by both developers and customers of the project’s demands and scope before anything begins. 
The stages are relatively rigid and often follow this sequence: 
- determine the project’s requirements and scope, 
- analyze those requirements, 
- design, 
- implement, 
- test, 
- deploy 
- and finally, maintain.
```
### Pros:
```
- Easy to manage due to well-defined starting and endpoints for each step
- High-degree of accuracy surrounding cost estimates
- Clearly defined requirements and outcomes
- Technical documentation is created during initial requirement gathering
- Test scenarios are defined in functional specifications
```
### Cons:
```
- Slow delivery speed compared to other methodologies
- Inflexibility regarding changes to initial requirements
- Difficulty in defining the functional specifications of client requirements
- Not suitable for large projects
```

## V-Model

The V-Model builds on the foundation of the Waterfall model that includes a testing phase associated with each development stage. 
- It is also known as the validation and verification model. 
```
The V-Model is one of the most inflexible yet thorough of the various SDLC testing methodologies. Each phase of the model must be successfully completed before the next one begins.
```

### Pros:
```
- Identifies defects early in the development process
- High success rate
- Simple to understand and easy to implement
- Saves time by incorporating planning for testing before coding begins
```
### Cons:
```
- Extremely rigid and inflexible
- Early prototype creation is impossible
- Updating test and requirement documents to reflect changes can take time
```
